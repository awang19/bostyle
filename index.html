					Sounds like the description of a cheesy teenage heroine, but this isn’t fiction. Cultural appropriation is real life. KIM + ONO is a culprit brand. KIM + ONO is a modern retailer for artison kimonos, a traditional Japanese dress. The craft behind the kimonos are well researched. The two founding sisters, Tiffany and Renee Tam, are Asian. Neither of these facts excuse the overwhelming usage of non-Asian models to showcase these Japanese dresses. 

					<br>
					<br>

					Marketing reasons is not enough of an excuse, as non-Asian women may feel less obligated to respect the traditional Japanese element of the kimono because of the way they are marketed. Consciously or subconsciously, the Japanese tie behind the fashion is lost, as once again, culture is white-washed for profit. Recognizing cultural appropriation isn’t always easy, as we still live in a society where the profitization of culture is normal. However, especially as Asian-Americans, we have an active duty to fight against it. Please, Ms. Tiffany and Ms. Renee, I urge you to consider giving credit where credit is due, and feature Asian models for your clothing line. The design pays respectable tribute to the Japanese cultural wear, but would be better represented by Japanese-Americans, or at least, Asian-Americans. 

					<br>
					<br>

					Furthermore, a page dedicated to the history and meaning behind the kimono would further distance your product from the ugly nod of cultural appropriation. 

					<br>
					<br>
					Thank you for taking the time to appreciate the concerns of a young Asian-American.
					
					<br>
					<br>
					Looking forward to your response,
					
					<br>
